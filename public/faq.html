<li><b>What is bugboard.org?</b>
Ever turn up to a code sprint/bug jam only to find you have nothing to jam on? Well, bugboard.org is here to help with that. Before the big day of the event, you can scour the bug tracking archives for bugs that would be good to work on and add them to the bucket of 'Proposed' bugs (a bucket is just a list of bugs - can be Proposed, Assigned or Completed). Then, on the day, simply let the good folks that turn up to your bug jam (or yourself) choose what bugs to work on - it's as simple as 'assigning' the bug to the person by editing the bug. The overall aim is to get things into the 'completed' bucket, though truth be told the real aim is to have fun! You probably don't need a bucket to tell you how to do this :-) For more info check out our <a href="/faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.

<li><b>What's kind of bugs should I add?</b>
If you're new to all this then it would be good to look for 'low hanging fruit' - easy problems you can pick off and help build your confidence with a new language or application.You can find a bug you might be interested in by looking through https://bugs.launchpad.net, https://bugzilla.gnome.org or https://bugs.kde.org. You are more than welcome to just add a new bug directly to the <i>assigned</i> bug bucket if you just want to let people know of a bug you're working on. They might be interested in the same area or may be able to help. Often a good idea can arise by just discussing a problem. As bugboard.org is new and there isn't a big list of proposed bugs if you're thinking of proposing a bug to work on then just go ahead! But please at least skim the 'What bugboard.org is not' section below first.

<li><b>What's a Bug Bucket?</b>
A Bug Bucket tells you what state the bug is in, either Proposed, Assigned or Completed. If you come across a bug that you might like to work on at a bug jam or even at home by your good self then add it as a Proposed bug. You can also add bugs that you think would be a good candidate for other people at an up and coming bug jam. The Assigned bucket is the pool of bugs people are actively working on. And completed is those bugs we've said hasta la vista to! We chose the word Bug Bucket instead of Status to avoid clashing with the Status field that is usually used by different bug trackers online. And it sounded a bit cuter...</li>
<li><b>What bugboard.org is not.</b>There is a danger that people will think that bugboard.org is a bug tracking tool in it's own right - it is not. It's simply a means of allocating existing bugs in other online bug tracking to those wonderfully cheery out there we call developers.</li>
<li><b>Why is this site so beautiful?</b>If you think bugboard.org is beautiful then maybe it's time to visit your optician. But you can help. The source code for bugboard.org is shortly to be made available on github.com and your help as a developer or design would would be greatly appreciated. Right now there is very very little code running behind the scenes. It's a great time to get aboard a Ruby on Rails project so if you're interested send a mail to the Ruby Ireland mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/ruby_ireland expressing an interest.</li>
